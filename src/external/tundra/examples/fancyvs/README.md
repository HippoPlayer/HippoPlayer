This example generates a VS2012 solution with most bells and whistles.

To try it out run `tundra2 -g msvc110`.

This will generate three solutions in vs2012 that you can open up in Visual
Studio 2012. One of them has both projects, the other two only one. Note that
when you build, Tundra always seems the complete DAG in both cases. It's merely
a presentation issue.
