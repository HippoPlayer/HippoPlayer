  Hello folks !


This is libmikmod, version 3.1.10, a portable sound library for Unix.
Check out the file 'NEWS' for more history information.


>> BUILDING LIBMIKMOD
---------------------

- If you're not building libmikmod for Windows, then you're lost in the
  sources. Go up one directory, and read the main README file.

So, you're on an angry fruit salad Windows system, aren't you ? With
those so cute icons and an overflowed system tray ?

Currently, libmikmod can be build under Windows only with the Microsoft
compiler (but I suppose that the Watcom compiler and Metrowerks
Codewarrior could be used as well).
You'll need the DirectX SDK (if not included with the compiler) to
compile the DirectSound driver; version 5 or better is required. The
standard Win32 SDK is enough for the winmm driver.

Oh, I almost forgot: you need long filenames to compile libmikmod, but
that should not be a problem nowadays.

You might want to edit one of the files 'Makefile.dynamic' and
'Makefile.static' located in the 'win32' directory to suit your
particular compiler setup. Then, in the 'win32' directory, run

	nmake -f Makefile.static

to build a static library, or

	nmake -f Makefile.dynamic

to build a DLL with its import library. 
If the build fails, I'd like to hear from you to correct the problem.

Be warned that both Makefiles put their object files in the same
directory. If you want to switch between the two makefiles, don't forget
to do a make clean first:
  
	nmake -f Makefile.dynamic clean
	
(or the same command with Makefile.static).

To make your library ready to use, copy the file '..\include\mikmod.h'
to your compiler include directory, and 'mikmod.lib` to your compiler
library directory. If you built a DLL, you'll also have to put
'mikmod.dll' somewhere in your PATH.

HTML documentation of the library, for programmers, is located in the
doc directory.


>> THANKS
---------

I would like to thank everyone who contributed to libmikmod. Their names
are in the AUTHORS file for the significative contributions, but some
other names can be found in the NEWS file. Thanks a lot ! Keeping
libmikmod alive wouldn't be much fun without you.
