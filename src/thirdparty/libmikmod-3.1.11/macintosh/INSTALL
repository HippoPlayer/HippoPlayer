>> BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR libmikmod FOR MACINTOSH
-------------------------------------------------

Requirements (to run):
- 680x0 or PowerPC Macintosh
- Sound Manager 2.0 or above
- CFM68K for 680X0 shared library

Requirements (to compile):
- Metrowerks CodeWarrior
- Apple MPW

To compile and build :

A) Using CodeWarrior
--------------------

1) Open "libmikmod.mcp" with CodeWarrior IDE
2) Set Current Target : "¥ All Libraries"
3) Make

Temporary stuff (can be deleted afterwards)
- "libmikmod Data" folder

CodeWarrior Pro 5 is needed to open the supplied project.
If you have an older version of CodeWarrior and wish to recreate the project,
you can see which files are included in the project at the following address:
  http://www.algonet.se/~afb/mikmod/mikmodfiles.gif

B) With MPW
-----------

1) Open MPW Shell
2) Run the Script : "BuildLibmikmod"

Temporary stuff (can be deleted afterwards)
- "libmikmod.makeout" textfile
- "obj","objppc" folders

Only tested with the CW compilers from Metrowerks (CodeWarrior MPW).
For other setups, you might need to edit the "libmikmod.make" file.

I'm interested in how to make it compile with SC/MrC, please mail me if you
succeed.


>> TARGETS
----------

Builds the following files:
- libmikmod				# Fat (680X0+PowerPC) Shared Library    ['shlb']
- libmikmodStub			# Fat Stub Link Library (no code/data)  ['stub']

The various parts that are mixed into the above fat libraries:
- libmikmod68k.lib		# 680X0 stub library
- libmikmodPPC.lib		# PowerPC stub library
- libmikmod68k.dll		# 680X0 shared library
- libmikmodPPC.dll		# PowerPC shared library
(these 4 files can be deleted, since they are also present in the fat libs)

- libmikmod 68k         # 680X0 Static Library for CodeWarrior C/C++
- libmikmod PPC			# PowerPC Static Library for CodeWarrior C/C++


>> INSTALLING
-------------

Move "libmikmod" to the Extensions folder of your System Folder.
Move "libmikmodStub" and "mikmod.h" to your Compiler Folder, for instance
(just somewhere along your libmikmod-using project's search path)

These three files (libmikmod,libmikmodStub, mikmod.h)
can also be downloaded directly from my web page (see URL below).
If you have troubles compiling them yourself, that is.


Enjoy!
