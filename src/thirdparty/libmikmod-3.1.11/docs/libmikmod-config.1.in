.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIlibmikmod-config\fP is a tool that is used to configure to determine
the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile
and link programs that use \fIlibmikmod\fP. It is also used internally
to the .m4 macros for GNU autoconf that are included with \fIlibmikmod\fP.

.TP 8
.B  \-\-cflags
Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a \fIlibmikmod\fP
program.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-prefix=PREFIX
If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that \fIlibmikmod\fP
was built with when computing the output for the \-\-cflags and \-\-libs
options. This option is also used for the exec prefix if \-\-exec\-prefix was
not specified. This option must be specified before any \-\-libs or \-\-cflags
options.
