The latest development version of SDL is available via Subversion.
Subversion allows you to get up-to-the-minute fixes and enhancements;
as a developer works on a source tree, you can use svn to mirror that
source tree instead of waiting for an official release. Please look
at the Subversion website ( http://subversion.tigris.org/ ) for more
information on using svn, where you can also download software for
MacOS, Windows, and Unix systems.

  svn checkout http://svn.libsdl.org/branches/SDL-1.2

If you are building SDL with an IDE, you will need to copy the file
include/SDL_config.h.default to include/SDL_config.h before building.

If you are building SDL via configure, you will need to run autogen.sh
before running configure.

There is a web interface to the subversion repository at:
	http://www.libsdl.org/cgi/viewvc.cgi

There is an RSS feed available at that URL, for those that want to
track commits in real time.
