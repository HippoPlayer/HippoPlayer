gbsplay INSTALL instructions


### BASIC INSTRUCTIONS

Run "make".  This should autoconfigure and build all files.  If you
have GTK and XMMS development files installed, the XMMS library will
also be built.

Run "make install" (as root) to install everything to your system.
Run "make uninstall" (as root) to remove it afterwards.

Be aware that you need a GNU make!
So on FreeBSD, you need to run "gmake" instead of "make".

If you want to build the XMMS plugin, you must have the XMMS
development files installed (header files etc.).  If you have
installed XMMS but the configure script does not detect it, you
probably need to install an extra package named something like
"xmms-dev".

Note to Solaris users:
Solaris /bin/sh is not POSIX compatible (${foo#bar} and ${foo%bar} are
not supported), please change the first line of configure to from /bin/sh
to /usr/bin/ksh.


### CUSTOMIZING THE INSTALLATION TARGET

To change the installation target, run the configure script manually
and pass some parameters (see "./configure --help" for a list):

$ ./configure --prefix=/tmp/GBSPLAY
$ make
$ make install

Remember to use the same prefix on uninstall!



### CUSTOMIZING THE XMMS PLUGIN PATH

Installing the XMMS plugin to another directory is a bit tricky :-)
Upon configure, the XMMS plugin target path is detected by running
`xmms-config --input-plugin-dir`.  You can not change this path!
But you can prepend it with another path.  Use XMMSPREFIX= for this.

Example:

$ ./configure --prefix=/tmp/GBSPLAY/usr
$ make
$ make install XMMSPREFIX=/tmp/GBSPLAY

This will install to /tmp/GBSPLAY/usr/(bin|man|share/doc) and put the
XMMS plugin to /tmp/GBSPLAY/$(xmms-config --input-plugin-dir).

This is probably what you want to do if you plan to
"install everything under /tmp/GBSPLAY".
