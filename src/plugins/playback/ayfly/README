How-to compile Ayfly:

wxWidgets is required to build the program. Tested with version 3.0.x.
For Linux SDL library is also required.

Installing build dependencies on Debian 10 ("buster"):
    sudo apt install build-essential automake libwxgtk3.0-dev libsdl1.2-dev

Ayfly uses standard automake tools. You can build it as follows:

For Linux:
    autoreconf -i && ./configure && make && sudo make install

For Windows (mingw32):
    autoreconf -i && ./configure mingw32 && make && make install

s60 directory is for symbian 9 build.

* When (cross-)compiling ayfly with mingw you need mingw-g++, mingw-gcc, wxWidgets library and friends in your PATH.
* DirectX libraties are required. You should copy headers in /path/to/directx/include and libs in /path/to/directx/lib. Default path is /opt/directx
